= justjs =

justjs is an autobiographical, open-source blog about node.js development. I'll be using it to blog about it, just as soon as there is enough functionality in place.

To get it running you'll need to install node and mongodb and do 'npm install', then:

node server.js

You can override anything in 'options' in 'config-local.js' (see config-local-example.js).

This is a work in progress. As of this writing it is not a production-ready blog. See the commit log for current status.
